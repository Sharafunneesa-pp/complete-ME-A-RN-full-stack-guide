there are synchronous and asynchronous call

if it is synchronus it will go into call stack directly

asynchronous are a type like there need delay in execution .web api is handling that,
so if there is any asynchronous function it will go into call queue(based on the time given as a paremeter)

from call queue only it goes to call stack.but it cannot go directly into call stack.
call stack should be empty.so for that we are using " event loop ".

event loop will check whether stack empty or not.
if empty it will go one by one and do execution.



javascript is a synchronous language only.but it can behave like asychrnous using web api.
all asynchronous functioncalls (eg:settimeout) will go into web api.from there it will go intoweb ipi.from there it insert into queue and using event loop it check whether it is emplty stack
if stack empty,it will enteredv into it.


client sending request to server.
so there should be definitely a time delay for getting response.so such request can handle only by asynchronous way.
